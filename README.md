MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve data. It's known for its reliability, scalability, and ease of use. 
MySQL stores data in tables made up of rows and columns, and uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to define, manipulate, control, and query data. The database structure is organized into physical files that are optimized for speed, and the logical data model offers a flexible programming environment.
